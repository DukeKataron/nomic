##### 103: Turn Structure
> One turn consists of three parts in this order: 

>> (1) propose one rule-change.

>> (2) proposed rule change is voted on and either accepted or declined. If accepted, the change takes effect immediately.

>> (3) generate a random number between 1 and 6<sup>1</sup>. That number, plus the number of approvals of this player's proposal, is added to the player's score.
